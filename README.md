# What is SzymonScript:

SzymonScript is JavaScript based language which is created to be worse than JavaScript.
Don't ask why i choosed this file extension.

This compiler converts SzymonScript code to JavaScript code.

# Usage:

Just download ss_compiler.py (if there will be ready, I will aslo add .exe version),
install required libraries and start compiler.

Enter .sex file name to the program, and program will compile your SzymonScript code
to the JavaScript code.
